Compiling:
Before you compile you have to set a few values in the Makefile. Currently there
are no automatic detection of the Erlang erts or the include files. This is
planned in future releases. I'm not _very_ familiar with Makefiles yet but I'm
sure this can be achieved in some otherway. For now just do the following:

1) Change ERLDIR variable to point to the erlang directory E.g. 
   "/usr/local/lib/erlang/"
2) Change the version numbers for the erts-xxx and erl_interface-xxx
3) make

Note: Make sure you have ncurses dev libraries installed (you should already 
have them if you compiled erlang on the same machine).

Note2: The file cecho_commands.hrl is _generated_ it is not suppose to exist
in the include directory.

Usage:
The intention of this library is to have an API as close as possible to the 
ncurses library. Something things can't be translated and other things return
values instead of taking pointer arguments etc. Documentation is planned ASAP.

Examples:
There are several ways to run the examples but the easiest would be to run erl
from the root directory of cecho and then invoke the M:F(A). from the shell.

E.g:

$> erl -pa ebin

Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6.5 [source] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.6.5  (abort with ^G)
